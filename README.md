These are my solutions to the Codin Game puzzles. 

# Practice makes perfect
- learning algorithms
- aiming for shortest code (it may not always work)
- use the language creatively

# Resources I use
- RegEx: https://regex101.com/
- W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/
- Think Python book by Allen Downey (especially The Goodies chapter)
